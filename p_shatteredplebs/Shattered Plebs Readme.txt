

CS:GO Shattered Plebs.


----------Features and goals

- fully accurate first shots, as standing/crouching inaccuracy is removed from all weapons, except for unscoped sniper rifles
- more differentiation between the two opposing teams
- fewer undesirable guns
- a creative starting round without high-powered rifles (start with $2500)
- basic fraud rules for bot matches, for this you must run "exec gamemode_pleb" in console


----------Known issues

- to avoid worse bugs, the AWP and AW Covert are available in the inventory for both T and CT, their intended use is for the AWP to be a CT weapon and for the AW Covert to be a T weapon, and this can be done by setting them up appropriately in the inventory
- the AUG doesn't show a crosshair when unscoped, despite being a rifle


----------Changes
